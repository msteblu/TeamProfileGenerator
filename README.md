## Description

This is a command-line application using Node.js and the Inquirer package that allows work-teams to quickly generate an HTML page that organizes and stores their information (including roles, emails, GitHub profiles, and office numbers, among other things.) 

The application is structured using object-oriented programming, and is tested using the Jest package.

## Installation

This application is written in JavaScript and runs through the command-line. Clone and download the files from this repository in order to use it. Additionally, install the npm Inquirer package into the downloaded directory in order to run the prompts and, if you want to run the tests, install the npm Jest package. 

## Usage

After download, run the application using Node.js by typing "node index.js" into the command-line. The application will prompt you with questions about identifying information for the manager of your project, and then will allow you to add other team members as needed (engineers or interns). Answer all of the questions for each team member. Once you choose to not add any more team members, the application will generate an HTML file that will organize and display all of the user input.
